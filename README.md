# PityCalculator

## Overview
This project aims to offer a website to the playerbase of the (as of 04/2025) 3 most popular gacha video games made by the chinese company Hoyoverse. The website currently offers a calculator for the number of pulls that will be obtained by a date, as well as a preview of the current featured character banners on each game, along with their respective durations.

## Current functionalities
The website currently offers the possibility of alternating between banner information specific to each of the three games, as well as ways for the user to input their current in-game economies, which will be used in the calculations that will be used to calculate the equivalent number of pulls that will be obtained by the desired date, which is either selected through information available in the displayed banners or inputted by the user as well. The calculations factor in the pity system which is shared by the 3 games.

## Future functionalities
In the future, a multi-page system and backend features including an account system with a databank will be implemented in order to allow the development of a wishing history system that will be offered to the users in order to help them keep track of their wishing history across the three games. Additionally, small reworks to the current UI, mostly related to the positioning of buttons and other components, are to be made in order to acommodate said new features.

## Technical details
This project uses traditional HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Manipulation of the HTML elements is done through the DOM.
